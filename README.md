# susbot for pixelplace.io, made by deviousname

It is probably best if you use Python 3.7.9 or the imposter will jump out of a vent and get you:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/

-susbot works by opening an automated browser window and logging in through Reddit to bypass the CAPTCHA system of pixelplace.io-

If you do not have a Reddit account, you will need one in order to use susbot, otherwise you will need to rewrite the code to suit your non-Reddit needs.

Chrome is required, but Firefox can work with some small code changes if you know what you are doing (you need geckodriver.exe instead of chromedriver.exe)

chromedriver can be found here:  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

To run it: right click on susbot_main.py and open with IDLE then press F5 to run. Doubleclicking the file does not work.

Set your Reddit name and password in crewmate.py and then run susbotmain.py

IMPORTANT: All the imports need to be installed, if you don't know how to do that, I reccomend looking up how pip install for Windows 10 Python 3.7.9 which is what I use.

For example to install pyautogui you open your command prompt and type: pip install pyautogui

Different system setups may have different syntax, good luck! For example: python3 -m pip install pyautogui

The full list of imports you need to install are:

pyautogui: pip install pyautogui

keyboard: pip install keyboard

(https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/)

mouse: pip install mouse

(https://pypi.org/project/mouse/)

selenium: pip install selenium

googletrans: pip install googletrans

(https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/)

pyperclip: pip install pyperclip
